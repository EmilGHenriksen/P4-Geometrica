//other similar operators: <, >=, <=
//other potential similar operators: !<, !>, !<=, !>=  //probaly don't implement these, since they could just increase confusion, although easy to implement


//demonstration of some logic
bool impossible = isZero AND notZero;  //a && !a
bool alwaysTrue = isZero OR notZero;   //a || !a

//other similar operators: XOR, XNOR
//unary boolean operators: ! 

//no bitwise operations, since it doesn't fit the goal
