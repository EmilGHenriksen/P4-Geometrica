//------angle stuff-------
angle A IS 60deg;
angle B IS 100deg;
angle C IS 20deg;
//triangle ABC IS new triangle(A, B, C); //what about size, coordinate and overall angle?


//angle A2 = B2 = C2 = 60deg; //not allowed (B2 and C2 not declared)
//angle A = B = 60deg = C; //not allowed ("60deg = C" is not possible)
//angle A = B = C = 60deg; //not allowed (assignment is not an operator but a statement)


//Calculation example: making a line from a point, length and angle
point a IS newpoint(1, 2);
float length IS 7.5;
angle A IS 90deg;

float xB IS a.x + cos(A)*length; //"a.x" get the "a" point's x value
float yB IS a.y + sin(A)*length;
point b IS newpoint(xB, yB);
line line1 IS newline(a, b); //result
